          Mathematical Programming Games: motivation, algorithms and challenges 
        </h5>
       In many decision-making settings, a selfish agent seeks to optimize its benefit given some situational constraints. Mathematically, the decision-maker’s task is often formulated as an optimization problem whose solution provides a prescriptive recommendation on the best decision. However, decision-making is rarely an individual task: each selfish decision-maker often interacts with other similarly self-interested decision-makers.
        We explore the opportunities offered by the interplay of Mathematical Optimization and Algorithmic Game Theory by analyzing them through the lenses of a unified framework capable of integrating elements of the two disciplines. We introduce the taxonomy of Mathematical Programming Games (MPGs), simultaneous games where each agent decision problem is an optimization problem expressing a heterogeneous and possibly complex set of constraints. On the one hand, MPGs offer a rigorous and powerful mathematical framework for extending the broad family of problems involving the solution of combinatorial optimization problems – to name a few, logistics, scheduling, tactical decision-making – to a multi-agent setting. On the other hand, MPGs offer a novel perspective capturing the dynamics of strategic decision-making involving multiple agents solving optimization problems and help embed fairness paradigms into the decision-making process.
        We present a few motivating examples and applications of MPGs, and we overview the challenges and opportunities associated with this promising stream of research offers. (Joint work with M. Carvalho, G. Dragotto and S. Sankaranarayanan.)

          Fairness and Conflicts: Allocating Items and Resources
          <br>
        </h5> 
        Fairness issues have received widespread attention in combinatorial optimization. In this talk we will consider fair allocation problems related to subset sum and partitioning problems.
        <br>
      In the first part we consider the allocation of a bounded resource among several agents. For each agent the obtained share of the resource serves as a capacity bound for a subset sum problem with the agent’s item set. If a central decision maker maximizes the total sum of item weights, this may result in a highly un- balanced allocation of the resource to the agents and hence be perceived as unfair. On the other hand, more balanced allocations may be far from the overall optimum. Therefore, we will discuss the resulting <i>price of fairness</i>, based on maximin, Kalai–Smorodinski and proportional fairness.
      <br>
      In the second part items cannot be selected by the agents themselves but are allocated by the central decision maker from a common ground set. However, agents can express their preferences by setting a profit value for every item. The decider wants to assign each item to an agent such that the satisfaction, i.e. sum of profits, guaranteed for each of the agents gets as high as possible. This maximin problem is known as the so-called <i>Santa Claus problem</i>. We extend this problem by introducing an incompatibility relation between pairs of items described in terms of a <i>conflict graph</i>. Every subset of items assigned to one agent has to form an independent set in this graph. Thus, the allocation of items to the agents corresponds to a partial coloring of the conflict graph. For this setting we present complexity and algorithmic results depending on the properties of the given conflict graph.
      <br>
      To allow a more flexible approach of expressing preferences we also introduce a new satisfaction measure based on a directed preference graph of each agent. We measure the <i>dissatisfaction</i> of an agent by means of the number of non-assigned items for which no more preferred item is given to the agent. From a fairness perspective we want to allocate the items to the agents in a way that minimizes the maximum dissatisfaction among the agents. Again we obtain NP-hardness results as well as polynomial algorithms with respect to different underlying graph structures, such as trees, stars, paths, and matchings.
